## Overview

AWS DeepRacer is a platform created by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps users learn reinforcement learning (RL) through an exciting and hands-on approach. It features a 1/18th scale autonomous car that can be trained to navigate a track using RL models. Users develop and refine their models in a virtual racing simulator before testing them on the physical car.The platform also includes the AWS DeepRacer League, where participants compete globally, making learning fun and competitive. It‚Äôs designed to be accessible for beginners and offers tutorials and resources, providing a practical way to explore machine learning concepts.

## My AWS DeepRacer-Powered Experience

I had the exciting opportunity to compete in the AWS DeepRacer League for Bulgaria, where I achieved 6th place with a personal best time of 8.703 seconds. This competition challenged me to train and optimize a reinforcement learning model for autonomous racing, pushing me to refine my skills in machine learning and model tuning. The experience was both fun and insightful, giving me the chance to connect with like-minded individuals and dive deeper into the world of AI and autonomous systems. Competing locally and seeing my efforts pay off was a truly rewarding experience!

## From Model to Track

### üß† Step 1:

The first step was familiarizing myself with AWS DeepRacer's environment and understanding the basics of reinforcement learning. I explored the AWS DeepRacer console, set up my virtual environment, and began learning how to create and train models. This foundational step was essential in understanding how to apply machine learning algorithms to autonomous driving tasks. I also spent time reviewing the rules of the competition, ensuring I was well-prepared to tackle the challenge ahead.

### üíª Step 2: Setting Up the Model and Environment

In this step, I focused on configuring the AWS DeepRacer environment and setting up the simulation model. I worked with the AWS DeepRacer console to create and customize my racing model, selecting the appropriate settings for the track and car. This phase involved understanding the reinforcement learning algorithms and ensuring that my model was ready to learn from the simulated racing environment.
